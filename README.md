# POSSIST ROUND 2-SUBMISSION
The code for test by POSSIST

I am completely new to thing like BlockChain and as I have a web developer profile, I somehow lacks code playing skills.
I know some but not like pro.
So, 
1. I have uploaded the code that can be used to insert nodes in the Tree.
2. The genesis node will be created, if tree is empty or newly created.

I have created two versions for the program namely: 
 1. way1.c   //Create Genesys node finely
 2. way2.cpp //contain sample code as well
 
Both files do support the insertion of elements.
To run the C file:
    1. gcc way1.c
    2. ./a.out
    
To run the C++ file:
    1. g++ way2.cpp
    2. ./a.out
