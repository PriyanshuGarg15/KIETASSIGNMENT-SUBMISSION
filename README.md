# POSSIST ROUND 2-SUBMISSION
The code for test by POSSIST

I am completely new to thing like BlockChain and as I have a web developer profile, I somehow lacks code playing skills.
I know some but not like pro.
So, 
# I have uploaded the code that can be used to insert nodes in the Tree.
# The genesis node will be created, if tree is empty or newly created.
